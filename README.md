# HPV-immunization-for-MSM-multimodel-approach

# Summary
R code and data to fit various models for penile-anal HPV16 transmission among MSM. The models vary in sexual contact structure and natural history of infection, and are used to provide model-averaged predictions about the effectiveness of targeted vaccination. See the corresponding publication with supplementary annex: "Potential effectiveness of prophylactic HPV immunization for men who have sex with men in the Netherlands: a multi-model approach", PLOS Medicine 2019 (doi: ...)

# H2M Data
The data from the HIV & HPV in MSM (H2M) study that was used for modeling is available in various files in Data.
